<h3><a name="Icicle Creek"></a> Icicle Creek</h3>

	<img src = "creek.jpg" class = "align-left" width ="200" height = "300" alt = "creek"> 

	<p>Take a hike along Icicle Creek and watch the majestic waters flow. Enjoy the soothing sounds of the rushing water while standing amidst the surrounding trees. This hike is rated a double-boot because the climbing is moderately  strenuous. However, the land immediately around the creek is flat and allows for frequent rest stops.</p> 

	<p> There are so many hikes to choose from. Visit our web site or stop by one of our offices to learn about other exciting hikes. We can design a hike to meet your needs or the desires of your group.</p><br clear="left" />
